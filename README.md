# Free HL Data
Replacement data files for Half-Life/Counter Strike or other mods.  
**No assets from either Half-Life or Counter Strike are included in this repository.**



## Purpose:

All files included in this repository are licensed [CC0/Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).
Image files are either created from scratch or from Public Domain files.

Files are best used with projects such as [FreeCS](https://github.com/eukara/FreeCS) and other similar engines & games.

The goal of this project is to not create a pixel perfect version of the image files, but, to create images that do not look out of place. Rock Textures looks like rocks of similar colors, metal looks like metal, grass looks like grass, etc. Image files should be the same resolution as the original files. This project does not try to make "HD" or "High resolution" graphics.

# Notice!

**Do not use these files with client or servers that use anti-cheat software. Using these files may cause accounts to be banned.**  
**We are not resposible for any banned accounts due to use of these or other unofficial files.**
